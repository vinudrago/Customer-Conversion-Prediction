# Customer-Conversion-Prediction-for-an-Insurance-Company
Welcome to the Customer Conversion Prediction project repository for a New Age Insurance Company! In this project, I developed machine learning models to predict customer conversion for the insurance services offered by the company. This project showcases my skills in data preprocessing, model selection, and predictive analytics.

Project Overview
Project: Customer Conversion Prediction for New Age Insurance Company
Tools: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, Jupyter Notebook, matplotlib
Purpose
The primary goal of this project was to build accurate machine learning models that predict whether a potential customer will convert to the insurance services offered by New Age Insurance Company. By leveraging historical customer data and utilizing various machine learning algorithms, I aimed to provide actionable insights to the company's marketing and sales teams.

Data Source
The dataset used for this project contains information about prospective customers, including demographic details, interaction history, and whether they eventually became customers. The dataset included the following features:

Age Gender Occupation Marital Status Interaction History (e.g., number of calls, emails) Previous Insurance History Educational Qualification Previous Outcome Outcome (whether the customer converted) Analysis Steps

Throughout the project, I followed these key steps:

Data preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

Exploratory data analysis: Gaining insights into the distribution of features, exploring correlations, and identifying patterns.

Feature selection: Selecting relevant features based on analysis and domain knowledge.

Model training: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the selected models, and tuning hyperparameters.

Model selection: Trying out various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Model evaluation: Evaluating the models' performance using metrics like accuracy , F1-score and AUROC score.

Creating visualizations: Visualizing the results, including feature importance and performance metrics.

Files Included
